#Maurer Project

One small question which has been in the news:



## Categories

There are ~8 things law students eventually want to do with their degrees:

- politics / activism
- public defender
- sue tobacco companies
- wills & testaments / country lawyer
- Big Law
- environment
- clerking / scholarly research

These are the buckets for our histograms. They not only come with salary expectations but effectiveness / achievement in other directions.

We particularly want to detect law students who end up working outside law in low-paying unrelated jobs, or those who end up  working in law in low-paying occupations (paralegal, contract work, etc).




## Brian Z Tamanaha

Tamanaha, in _Failing Law Schools_, claims 50% non-response rates and various shady techniques are used to massage matriculant-facing salary figures.

> It is clear that law school is expensive. The book tells the story of how it came to be so expensive in an engaging, almost breathtaking way. 

Prospective students are interested in the % employed in law and the salary distribution. Administrators have been dishonest in reporting

### `LinkedIn` as a data source

Law schools may not accurately track their graduates. It's hard to get people to respond to a survey. But we can look for those people elsewhere. Many graduates

LinkedIn's bias is in the right direction: those looking for a job are more likely to be on it, than the gainfully-employed.




## Getting the lawyers' perspective

> Their complaint is that non-elite law schools are selling a fraudulent bill of goods. Law schools advertise deceptively high rates of employment and misleading income figures. Many graduates can’t get jobs. Many graduates end up as temp attorneys working for $15 to $20 dollars an hour on two week gigs, with no benefits. The luckier graduates land jobs in government or small firms for maybe $45,000, with limited prospects for improvement. A handful of lottery winners score big firm jobs.  […] This dismal situation was not created by the current recession—which merely spread the pain up the chain into the lower reaches of elite schools. This has been going on for years. The law graduates posting on these sites know the score. They know that law schools pad their employment figures—96% employed—by counting as “employed” any job at all, legal or non-legal, including part time jobs, including unemployed graduates hired by the school as research assistants (or by excluding unemployed graduates “not currently seeking” a job, or by excluding graduates who do not supply employment information). They know that the gaudy salary numbers advertised on the career services page—“average starting salary $125,000 private full time employment”—are actually calculated based upon only about 25% of the graduating class (although you can’t easily figure this out from the information provided by the schools). They know all this because they know of too many classmates who didn’t get jobs or who got low paying jobs—the numbers don’t jibe with their first hand knowledge. They know the score now. But they didn’t know it when they first applied to law school. […] - www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/

> Many law schools around the country are facing painful financial distress.  After enjoying flush times for going on two decades, the downturn has come with head-snapping swiftness and severity.  In 2010, ABA accredited law schools collectively enrolled 52,500 students—the highest number ever.¹  Immediately thereafter, the number of applicants to law school went into free fall, declining by about 10,000 each year thereafter.  Around 57,000 people will apply for seats in the entering class of 2013, down from a high of 100,000 applicants in 2004.² 

> To appreciate the implications of this decline, consider that every year in the past decade law schools have accepted 55,000 or more students (2012 data are currently unavailable).  Not everyone who applies to law school can be admitted, needless to say, and every year several thousand people who are admitted choose not to matriculate.  Extrapolating from recent patterns, it appears likely that law schools will enroll around 43,000 new students for the fall of 2013.  Total enrollment
has not been that low since 1999.3  Twenty additional law schools have been accredited since then, so the competition over students is fierce.

> Many law schools are offering higher scholarship amounts deeper into the class to entice people to enroll.  In past years typically only the top half of the entering class received scholarships, but now at some places bottom half students will get discounts as well.  Even then, many law schools will fall short of their enrollment targets—there are simply not enough bodies to go around.  Law schools in this position are losing revenue in two ways: fewer students in the seats and fewer
dollars from each student. 
> It gets worse.  Law school revenues run on three year cycles, each new class adding to the two previous classes.  Recall that the entering class of 2010 was the largest ever at many law schools; following that banner year, at many schools enrollment fell in 2011, and fell yet again in 2012—with 2013 promising further declines.  As a consequence, the highest-ever revenue supplied by the departing 2013 class (the bloated group that arrived in 2010) will be replaced by much lower revenue from the new entering class.   
> The severity of the situation can be seen through an illustration.  Golden Gate’s entering enrollment has fallen sharply: 320 (2010), to 229 (2011), to 185 (2012).  Tuition and fees total $42,000.  Let’s conservatively assume that Golden Gate nets $20,000 from each student (discounted for scholarships), and assume that no students transfer out or drop out (both almost certainly do occur).  Total revenue for academic year 2012-2013 ($14,689,000) will fall by $2.7 million in
2013-2014 even if Golden Gate miraculously manages to keep its enrollment from sliding any further.  Assuming the same size entering class in 2014, revenue will drop by another $880,000 the following year, before stabilizing.  It will be hard to trim expenses to match this decline because a significant portion of law school costs are fixed.
> […]  (The situation has deteriorated since the writing of the book nearly two years ago.)

> Annual tuition at about a dozen law schools now exceeds $50,000 (Columbia topping the list at $55,000), with many other law schools poised to follow.  Adding another $15,000 to $20,000 in annual living expenses, the three year out-of-pocket cost of obtaining a law degree for students without substantial scholarships is around or above $200,000 at dozens of law schools today.7

> Tuition has risen to these astronomical heights in a relatively short period of time, although it has been going up for decades.  In 2000, average tuition at private law schools was $21,790; in 2011, it was $39,184.8  Average tuition at public law schools also rose rapidly in this time span, going from $7,790 to $22,116.9  These increases occurred during a relatively low inflationary period.

> The rapid run up of tuition produced a rapid increase in debt levels for law students, about 90% of whom borrow to finance their legal education.  The average debt of private law school graduates went from $70,147 in 2001 to $124,950 in 2011; at public law schools over the same period, average debt increased from $46,499 to $75,728.10 Average debt levels for private law grads have gone up yearly by alarming amounts, rising from $91,506 (2009), to $106,249 (2010), to $124,950 (2011).11  Debt levels for the classes of 2012 and 2013 are undoubtedly much higher (data not yet released by the ABA).  Bear in mind that these figures substantially understate the total average debt students carry on graduation day because they do not include undergraduate debt (average $25,000) and they do not count interest accrued on debt while in law school, which can add thousands.

> Law school tuition and law graduate debt have gone up at the same time that law grads have struggled through the worst market for legal employment in decades, with many failing to land lawyer jobs, with unprecedented numbers of graduates taking part-time jobs and temporary jobs, and with many earning relatively low salaries.12 Only 54.9% of law graduates in 2011 had obtained long term full-time lawyer jobs within nine months of graduation; the success rate of 2012 grads improved slightly, to 56.2%.13  Median starting salary of 2011 graduates in private law jobs was only $60,000.14  

> The job market looks to be challenging for years to come.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor (BLS) statistics estimates about 22,000 lawyer openings annually through 2020 (counting departures and newly created jobs), at a time when law schools yearly put out over 40,000 new graduates.15  BLS outlook is blunt: “Competition should continue to be strong because more students are graduating from law school each year than there are [lawyer] jobs available.”16

> Thousands of liberal arts BAs grew up on those assumptions. “Everyone is pre-law,” journalist Michael Kinsley quipped, “until the day they enter medical school.” A JD himself, Kinsley knew whereof he spoke. […] The real issue is that a high-paying job has become the only kind a law grad can afford to accept. Why? As Tamanaha explains, law schools have spent the past quarter-century jacking up their tuition, from an average of $2,400 per year at public institutions in 1987 to $18,500 in 2009; the corresponding figures at private law schools are $8,900 and $35,750.  […] >Of the 201 ABA-accredited schools, only 12 reported that 80 percent of their 2011 graduates had landed full-time, long-term legal jobs, according to the Wall Street Journal. At almost two dozen less-prestigious schools, fewer than 40 percent of graduates had secured such jobs.

> Members of the law-school class of 2011 had little better than a 50-50 shot of landing a job as a lawyer within nine months of receiving a degree, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of new data that provides the most detailed picture yet of the grim market for law jobs.
> Under pressure from disillusioned graduates and some professors, the American Bar Association for the first time released a tally of the previous year's graduates who have secured full-time, permanent jobs as lawyers. Until recently, the ABA required law schools to report only general data about how their graduates fared, such as how many were employed full-time or part-time in any kind of job, whether or not it required a law degree.
> The numbers suggest the job market for law grads is worse than previously thought. Nationwide, only 55% of the class of 2011 had full-time, long-term jobs that required a law degree nine months after graduation. The ABA defines "long-term" jobs as those that don't have a term of less than one year.
> Of course, it isn't uncommon for people to attend law school to advance their career without practicing law. Several law-school deans cautioned against placing too much emphasis on jobs requiring a law degree.
> Nationally, 8% of 2011 graduates were said to be in full-time, long-term jobs for which a law degree was preferred but not required, according to the Journal's data analysis. Another 4% were employed in full-time, long-term positions for which professional training was required but for which a law degree offered no advantage.

> the American Bar Association (ABA) decides which law schools can be accredited, and it requires that law schools primarily employ tenured or tenure-track professors. Sixty-five percent of professors in American universities are employed in positions not eligible for tenure, but any law school that tried to match that proportion could lose its accreditation. As a result, law schools shoulder the cost of a permanent crop of highly compensated professors. Tuition at public law schools increased 200 percent, and at private law schools by 179 percent, throughout the 1980s. In the 1990s, law student debt quadrupled. Meanwhile, the job market for lawyers has contracted dramatically, and without any immediate prospect for improvement. In this climate, lenders might be less inclined to lend—except that the federal government has emerged as a major enabler. If your income is meager enough to make it difficult for you to pay back your law school loans, your monthly payment will be lowered, and the federal government will help. After twenty-five years for most lawyers and ten years for those working in public-service jobs, any remaining law school loan balance will be forgiven—paid for by the federal government and the American taxpayer. (This applies to some other professionals, as well, like doctors, but lawyers, on the whole, are the professionals who face the hardest time paying back their rising debt.)  […] law schools and the legal community convey that the status of the school is quite important, and students are already inclined to believe this. Enrollment choices are therefore too often made according to marginal differences in the status of the school rather than on the quality of the educational product and the cost at which it provides it. […] Since 2010, applications to law schools are down nearly 25 percent. Only about two-thirds of law school graduates are employed in jobs requiring passage of the bar examination, and 12 percent of graduates are unemployed.  […] urrent and future members of the legal community are more status-driven than almost any other professional community (witness that eight of nine Supreme Court Justices graduated from Harvard or Yale law schools
