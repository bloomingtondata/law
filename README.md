#Maurer Project

One small question which has been in the news:



## Categories

There are ~8 things law students eventually want to do with their degrees:

- politics / activism
- public defender
- sue tobacco companies
- wills & testaments / country lawyer
- Big Law
- environment
- clerking / scholarly research

These are the buckets for our histograms. They not only come with salary expectations but effectiveness / achievement in other directions.

We particularly want to detect law students who end up working outside law in low-paying unrelated jobs, or those who end up  working in law in low-paying occupations (paralegal, contract work, etc).




## Brian Z Tamanaha

Tamanaha, in _Failing Law Schools_, claims 50% non-response rates and various shady techniques are used to massage matriculant-facing salary figures.

Prospective students are interested in the % employed in law and the salary distribution. Administrators have been dishonest in reporting

### LinkedIn as a data source

Law schools may not accurately track their graduates. It's hard to get people to respond to a survey. But we can look for those people elsewhere. Many graduates

LinkedIn's bias is in the right direction: those looking for a job are more likely to be on it, than the gainfully-employed.

 "Thousands of liberal arts BAs grew up on those assumptions. “Everyone is pre-law,” journalist Michael Kinsley quipped, “until the day they enter medical school.” A JD himself, Kinsley knew whereof he spoke."

> Members of the law-school class of 2011 had little better than a 50-50 shot of landing a job as a lawyer within nine months of receiving a degree, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of new data that provides the most detailed picture yet of the grim market for law jobs.
> Under pressure from disillusioned graduates and some professors, the American Bar Association for the first time released a tally of the previous year's graduates who have secured full-time, permanent jobs as lawyers. Until recently, the ABA required law schools to report only general data about how their graduates fared, such as how many were employed full-time or part-time in any kind of job, whether or not it required a law degree.
> The numbers suggest the job market for law grads is worse than previously thought. Nationwide, only 55% of the class of 2011 had full-time, long-term jobs that required a law degree nine months after graduation. The ABA defines "long-term" jobs as those that don't have a term of less than one year.
